        "Since rice requires standing water during most of its growth, such soils are ideal for puddling and transplanting. "

        "Wheat prefers well-drained loamy or clay loam soils rich in organic matter. "
        "These soils store enough moisture for the crop but do not get waterlogged, which is important for wheatâ€™s growth during cooler and relatively dry seasons. "
        "Adding farmyard manure before sowing helps improve soil fertility and yield.",

    name: "Coconut",
    soil: "Sandy, Alluvial or Laterite Soil",

    soilDetails:
        "Coconut thrives in sandy, alluvial, or laterite soils that have good drainage and a high water table. "
        "Coconut roots need both moisture and aeration; therefore, waterlogged soils harm the plant, while overly dry soils reduce productivity. "
        "Farmers in coastal and river basin areas often get the best results, especially when they apply organic matter regularly.",
  ),
  Plant(
    name: "Millets",
    soil: "Light Sandy or Red Loamy Soil",
    imageUrl: "assets/images/millets.jpg",
    soilDetails:
        "Millets such as bajra, ragi, and jowar are hardy crops that do well in light, sandy, and red loamy soils which are well-drained. "
        "These soils suit dry and less fertile regions where other crops struggle to survive. "
        "Millets are particularly suitable for rainfed conditions, but heavy clay soils should be avoided as they retain excess water.",
